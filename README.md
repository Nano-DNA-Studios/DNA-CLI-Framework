# DNA-CLI-Framework
A C# framework to help quickly CLI Apps and Tools for crossplatform devices.


Inspired by a Framework I used at a previous COOP for Automation, the Framework makes it so that Command implementation requires minimal code, with only command implementation, while loading Data, cross command communication, customization and more is all done for you, or can be modularly swapped out using your own custom implementation.

Additional "Nice to haves" are included in the framework such as Progress Bars and Tables allowing you to cleanly display Data.

# Projects
Some of my favourite projects using the Framework are as follows

## [RocketLeagueReplayParserCLI](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/RocketLeagueReplayParserCLI) · [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/MrDNA) · ([DNA-CLI-Framework](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/DNA-CLI-Framework) / C#)

❖ Extracts info from Rocket League replay files. Used for game analysis. Uses DNA-CLI-Framework I developed.

## [OrcaAnalysis](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/OrcaAnalysis) · [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/MrDNA) · ([DNA-CLI-Framework](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/DNA-CLI-Framework) / C#)

❖ Extracts and performs Data Analysis on Orca Output files. Used by the UW Formula Nano Design Team

## [MolToXYZ](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/MOLToXYZCLI) · [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/MrDNA) · ([DNA-CLI-Framework](https://github.com/Nano-DNA-Studios/DNA-CLI-Framework) / C#)

❖ A CLI App that converts a .MOL file to a .XYZ File. Makes it more readable and easier to pipe to a Molecule to Orca
